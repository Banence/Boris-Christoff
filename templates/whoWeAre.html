          "Alex Zografov is one of the most brilliant musicians of our time - a virtuoso pianist, composer and orchestrator. He holds a PhD in composition from the University of Los Angeles. He was a teacher at the Seth Riggs Academy in Los Angeles to stars of the rank of Janet Jackson. Maestro Zografoff has a worldwide career in pop music, jazz and musicals. In Los Angeles he has worked with some of the biggest names in the industry such as Nana Muscouri, Frank Zappa, Joe Cocker, George Benson, Barbara Streisand, Sting, Jeff Beck and a host of other celebrities. He has personally staged nearly all of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals on Broadway as conductor and musical director. In Los Angeles, he began playing with the most famous musicians and orchestras in the world, such as the big band Everett Coven. His orchestra gathers some of the best professionals in the whole world. Before arriving in the USA, Alex Zografov worked in Toronto, where one of the largest American film studios wanted to buy his music to use in their films. He refused because he received an offer from Don Ellis - this was in 1977. At that time, Alex was experimenting a lot in jazz. He then worked briefly with Gino Vanelli. Around 1976, only he and Milcho Leviev were the Bulgarian musicians in Los Angeles. Maestro Zografov met with Queen Elizabeth II in Cyprus, where he organized a musical program to welcome her. Also, during his stay in Cyprus, he actively worked with one of the biggest stars of Greece, Yorgos Dalaras. In recent years, he has devoted himself mostly to composing. He has choral, film music, compositions for the symphony orchestra, and the peak of his work is the opera &quot;Orpheus Lives&quot;, whose world premiere will take place in 2023.
          
          Here are the original words about Alex from some of the greatest musicians in the world and those of Queen Elizabeth herself:
          
          &quot;You are the most impressive musician I've ever heard!&quot; - Frank Zappa 
          &quot;Alex performs with great conviction.&quot; - George Benson
          &quot;You are great! I could listen to you play and sing all night!&quot; - Mel Torme
          &quot;Alex, I'll catch up with you, yet!&quot; - Joe Cocker 
          &quot;If I ever play again, I would love to play with you. Listening to your music is like visiting places I have never been!&quot; - Don Ellis
          &quot;It was wonderful! A wonderful performance!&quot; - Queen Elizabeth II">Read more
