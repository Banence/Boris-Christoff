                In recent years, the Boris Hristov Foundation has held a series of celebrations, donation campaigns, events and concerts related to the 100th anniversary of Maestro Hristov. Part of the cycle of celebrations realized by the Foundation was the naming and grand opening of the first hall in Sofia, named after Boris Hristov. In this hall, located in the Central Military Club in Sofia, stands the sculpture of Boris Hristov, created by Professor Chapkanov, which our Foundation donated to the Ministry of Defence. This was a unique event - the fruit of the joint efforts of the Boris Hristov Foundation, Professor Georgi Chapkanov and three Ministers of Defence of the Republic of Bulgaria, which once again proved that when there is a true, national cause it meets continuity at all levels and unites our nation!
